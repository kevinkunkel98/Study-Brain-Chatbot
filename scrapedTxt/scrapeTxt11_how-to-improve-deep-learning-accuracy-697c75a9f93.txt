The collection of options is not complete, however it is a good starting point. The objective is to provide you with several ideas for things to try, maybe one or two that you may not have considered. To receive a boost, you generally just need one brilliant thought. Below are the list for possibleAdding More LayersAdding more layers to your model improves its capacity to learn the features of your dataset more thoroughly. But we can only do so to a certain degree. There is a cap. Afterwards when, rather than extracting features, we overfit the data and the complexity. Overfitting can result in mistakes of many kinds, such as false positives. This implies that it will be able to detect small distinctions that you, as a human, may have overlooked.Adding More DataOverall performance of the training data typically limits the performance of the models. You want the greatest possible data for your situation. You also need a lot of it. Deep neural networks are only as efficient as the data that is fed into them. Adding new data has been one of the simplest methods to improve validation accuracy. This is very handy if you dont have a lot of training cases.Data AugmentationWhen you cant get additional data in a reasonable amount of time, you can create new data. Data augmentation is a method of creating additional training data from existing training data. It is accomplished by applying domain specific approaches to examples from the training data, resulting in new and distinct training instances. For Image data augmentation is a technique for artificially increasing the size of a training dataset by modifying photographs in the dataset. Generating transformed versions of training data images that are members of the same class as the original image. Shifts, flips, zooms, and many more picture alteration techniques are included in the category of transforms.Rescale Your DataImprove With Algorithm TuningDeep learning is about algorithms. Different approaches for learning a decision process from data are described by all the theory and math. Youve decided to tackle your issue with deep learning. Maybe your chosen algorithms is not the best for your problem. So maybe you can drop the current model and use something a lot simpler, a lot faster to train, even something that is easy to understand. Maybe you are using a simple train/test split, this is very common. If so, you need to ensure that the split is representative of the problem. Remember if the simple model solve the problem dont go for complex.Increase EpochsAn epoch in machine learning means one complete pass of the training dataset through the algorithm. This epochs number is an important hyperparameter for the algorithm. It specifies the number of epochs or complete passes of the entire training dataset passing through the training or learning process of the algorithm. You can increase the number of epochs in order to improve the accuracy but make sure to use early stopping to prevent model from overfitting.Decrease Color ChannelsIn channels or color planes, image files store color information. Color channels such as RGB, HSL, or CMYK can be separated from an image. Red, green, and blue make up the three channels of an RGB image. Three channels make up an HSL image: hue, saturation, and lightness. Although the CMYK paradigm cannot be used to create or edit images, it is still possible to divide an image into four channels: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.For each color channel, you can generate a new grayscale image; the original image remains unaffected. An HSL image, for instance, is divided into three distinct grayscale images called Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Each grayscale image shows the amount and location of a certain color (like red) or feature (like brightness) within the image.So in short convert image into a grayscale.These approaches will work but not always guaranteed best is to follow the literature and trail of different approaches.----3I am a young, creative, and enterprising person who likes challenges.
