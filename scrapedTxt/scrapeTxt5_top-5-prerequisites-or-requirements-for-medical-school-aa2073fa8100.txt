Med. Sch. TimesFollow--ListenShareGood grades are a bit overrated. These are the real deal.Every human, educated or not, is well aware that medical schools always pick excellent students. It is mostly the bright and brilliant would have a chance of flashing out their stethoscopes with pride someday. Well, I totally understand why its so. Medical school is tough, even for the smartest students. It is one of the few places that can cause you, a straight As student from high school, to doubt your intelligenceits no joke! You would write an exam with expectations of getting an A only to find a C next to your name and a huge shock all over your face. You feel youve been cheated and when you get the opportunity to see your answer sheets side by side the lecturers marking scheme, you may end up feeling fortunate to have a C. There, you would realise that the expectations are high, and the competition, higher. You would think youre such a prodigy until you are labelled as an average student in medical school, or worse, the struggling onewho wines and dines with resits but still manages to graduate successfully; you can say that the end justifies the means.Excellent grades would take you to medical school, but you need much more than that to keep you there. Besides, there have been many instances of average students becoming better doctors than the top students. Below are the top 5 prerequisites for medical school, that must never be taken for granted.Learn to spend sometime alone to reflect on your life, as you ponder on certain questions that would help to enrich your self-knowledge. Do you know your strengths and weaknesses? These would aid you to choose your battles wisely and make good decisions. What about your limits, in terms of anger, tolerance, and how much of compassion or empathy do you have? You would need this to know whether medicine is indeed for you and perhaps what area to specialize in after medical school. Then what about your goals? Dont end at finishing medical school; of course you will definitely finish! You can set a target of having accruing $10,000 in your account after completing medical school by engaging in a side hustle while in school, or you could choose to sell your soul to the training in hopes of fulfilling your dream of graduating as the best student. You need to have clear goals, for they greatly affect your decisions, actions and inactions in medical school. Knowing your interests and talents would serve you well too. Who knows? Your interest in school politics may groom you into a statesman or stateswoman someday.Well, you cant know everything about yourself. We undergo tiny changes each day that usually become apparent after sometime. Take a good look at your life. You would notice some differences in your mentality, goals, interests and even worries today, from those of 10 years ago. Do well to keep up and discover more about yourself even in medical school. That self-knowledge of would reward you handsomely.Knowing some time management strategies is cardinal to a successful medical journey. But of what essence is something that only exists as knowledge but cannot be put to use or produce expected fruits? You can try to apply all the strategies you know, but without discipline, you would score a zero.Discipline is what would drag you out of bed by 6am when you have a lecture in the next hour. It is discipline that would keep you at your desk and your eyes glued to your books, even when your bed is just an arms length away.I have had many instances of writing down a to-do list of topics I must finish studying in a day or created the perfect personal timetable for a number of modules but failed to go by it. I had this faulty mindset that once I have written down my plans, then the work or activities could be considered as done. I would perform the first two activities on my list and then have this overwhelming feeling of joy that makes me let my guard down. Afterwards, I feel that I can play around a little, thus, giving in to distractions. At the end of the day, I would have done no more than those two activities and at that point, I am left with no choice but to postpone those undone to another day, setting myself up for stress that could have been prevented! Of course, some important things may come up during the day and you would need to tweak your plans by pushing some work to another day insteadthats alright.When I realised this pattern, I became more aware of myself and what exactly those distractions were. This knowledge has enabled me to find solutions, which includes, not scrolling down to see more suggested videos when I visit YouTube but rather, going straight to the search bar to get some important information needed in my studies (YouTube is a very good friend of mine since I learn best through videos).Another solution I have put in place is reminding myself of the terrible stress and strain procrastination brings. It drives me back to focus anytime Im being swayed away. Maybe your solution could be to remind yourself of your goal to graduate as the best student. That wonderful feeling coming from imagining your hands full with many awards on your graduation day can put you on your toes.This is the best stress management technique you would need in the medical field. There would be days when you wouldnt like to go to class, or go far as questioning your reason for choosing medicine in the first place! Certain situations would tempt you to call some days bad days but hey, thats not the way to go. Learn to see the silver lining in every cloudor learn to drink water like its wine. A positive attitude wouldnt lessen the stress, but it would make it more bearable.You would have to attend a boring class, study your least favourite module, get scolded by a resident in front of a patient and your colleagues, or study loads of handouts that thinking about it alone gives you a bad headache. Ive experienced these things before and they keep coming. However, I realised that anytime I affirm my love for that boring module or topic, I feel motivated to study it. Think about it, isnt it much easier to do what you love than what you loathe? This positive attitude was of great help to me anytime I felt tired of studying community medicine, especially when the exams was imminent.You had an F in a module, and so what? That doesnt make you a failure. Look, failure is an important part of success you can never do without. It would come, perhaps you may avoid it in medical school, but it is inevitable anyways. The good news is, failure is not fatal. Its neither the end of the world nor the reason to go as far as considering suicide! Yeah, some students obsess over school grades that much.Sometimes, I dont blame us medical students. Before we enter medical school, we know nothing about failing a course and so failing for the first time in the medical field may create feelings of disappointment in yourself and you may doubt your great intellect too.The first time I had an F, I couldnt believe it. I was sad, I felt useless and I lost a lot of self-confidence too. After sometime, I got tired of wallowing in self-pity and then I knew I had to pick myself up and make things right. That failure was a big lesson to not take anything about medical school for granted. Perhaps your failure could be pointing out your bad study habits or show you that you may be investing too little time into your medical training, which would then cause you to allocate more time to your studies.This virtue of resilience is highly valuable both in the medical field and life in general. Learn to see failures as roads to successfor thats what they really are.Lets say you are someone who cannot work at your best after anything less then 8 hours of sleep in a day. You would have to learn to get by with less than that, especially during a 24hr duty at the hospital. Or you hate math so much that medicine was an escape route from it but little did you know that you would encounter some statistics in your community medicine module? In this case, you need to find a way of getting comfortable with math.Also, you would meet lecturers, supervisors and doctors with different preferences and their idiosyncrasies, which for example, would cause a consultant to expect students to examine patients in a particular style while another would prefer a different style. As a student, you need to adapt to their preferences and learn from them too. Theres no point in getting angry with them since they are the seniors and your irritation, if not controlled, could land you into big trouble!At this point, Im sure you would agree that indeed, without these 5, medical school would be a hard road and a difficult trek. Whether youre already in medical school, or youre about entering, assess yourself with these five points to find where you fall short and work towards becoming better in that area.Signed, Richeal.----It's all about the priceless experiences, lessons and overall journey in Medical School.
