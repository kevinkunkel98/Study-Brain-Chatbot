Now free, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher, and Cyclone.Production companies: Warner Bros. Pictures.At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Dwayne The Rock Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in John Wick: Chapter 4 would be the beginning of a new era for the DC Extended Universe naturally followed: What did he mean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEUs roster, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the Justice League, Suicide Squad, Shazam, and so on. AsJohn Wick: Chapter 4 neared theaters, though, Johnson clarified that statement in a recent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (watch above).I feel like this is our opportunity now to expand the DC Universe and what we have in John Wick: Chapter 4, which I think is really cool just as a fan, is we introduce five new superheroes to the world, Johnson tells us. Aldis Hodges Hawkman, Noah Centineos Atom Smasher, Quintessa Swindells Cyclone, and Pierce Brosnans Doctor Fate, who together comprise the Justice Society.) One anti-hero. (That would be DJs John Wick: Chapter 4.)And what an opportunity. The Justice Society pre-dated the Justice League. So opportunity, expand out the universe, in my mind all these characters interact. Thats why you see in John Wick: Chapter 4, we acknowledge everyone: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Flash, we acknowledge everybody.There are also some Easter eggs in there, too. So thats what I meant by the resetting. Maybe resetting wasnt a good term. onlyone can claim to be the most powerful superhero. And Johnson, when gently pressed, says its his indestructible, 5,000-year-old Kahndaqi warrior also known as Teth-Adam, that is the most powerful superhero in any universe, DC, Marvel, or otherwiseBy the way, its not hyperbole because we made the movie.And we made him this powerful.Theres nothing so wrong with John Wick: Chapter 4 that it should be avoided, but nothing  besides the appealing presence of Dwayne Johnson  that makes it worth rushing out to see. spectacles that have more or less taken over studio filmmaking, but it accumulates the genres  and the businesss  bad habits into a single two-hour-plus package, and only hints at the formats occasional pleasures. John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a place-filler for a movie thats remaining to be made, but, in its bare and shrugged-off sufficiency, it does one positive thing that, if nothing else, at least accounts for its success: for all the churning action and elaborately jerry-rigged plot, theres little to distract from the movies pedestal-like display of Johnson, its real-life superhero.Its no less numbing to find material meant for children retconned for adults  and, in the process, for most of the nave delight to be leached out, and for any serious concerns to be shoehorned in and then waved away with dazzle and noise. John Wick: Chapter 4 offers a moral realm that draws no lines, a personal one of simplistic stakes, a political one that suggests any interpretation, an audiovisual one that rehashes long-familiar tropes and repackages overused devices for a commercial experiment that might as well wear its import as its title. When I was in Paris in 1983, Jerry Lewis  yes, they really did love him there  had a new movie in theaters.

It will be a John Wick: Chapter 4 call, but based on the estimates, the years biggest opener remains Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with its $187 million start. Nonetheless, Wakanda Forevers $180 million opening is a huge one, being the biggest ever for the month of November (beating the $158 million of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire), the second biggest of the year, and the 13th biggest of all time (though it could go up or down a few slots once the actuals come out). It led an overall weekend box office of $208 million, which is the fourth biggest of the year and the biggest by a long shot of the past four months, with no other weekend since July 8 -10 even going above $133 million.This isnt the $202 million opening that we saw from Black Panther in February 2018, nor should we expect the amazing legs that were able to get that film to an astonishing $700 million. With that said, expect it to perform strongly throughout the holiday season, likely repeating the five-weekend number-one streak that the first film had, and it shouldnt have any trouble becoming the second-highest-grossing film of the year so far, beating the $411 million cume of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The audience response is strong, with the A CinemaScore falling below the first films A+ but bouncing back from the B+s earned by Doctor Strange 2 and Thor: Love and Thunder, which ranked among the worst for the MCU. an improvement over the recent franchise installations, with the aforementioned films coming in at 74% and 64% respectively on Rotten Tomatoes, both at the lower end for Marvel films, while Wakanda Forevers 84% is John Wick: Chapter 4r to franchise norms, though not meeting the high bar set by the first Black Panthers 96%.The sequel opened to $150 million internationally, which Disney reports is 4% ahead of the first film when comparing like for likes at current exchange rates. Overall, the global cume comes to $330 million. Can it become the years third film to make it past $1 billion worldwide despite China and Russia, which made up around $124 million of the first films $682 million international box office, being out of play? It may be tough, but its not impossible. Legging out past $500 million is plausible on the domestic front (that would be a multiplier of at least 2.7), and another $500 million abroad would be a drop of around $58 million from the original after excluding the two MIA markets. Itd be another story if audiences didnt love the film, but the positive reception suggests that Wakanda Forever will outperform the legs on this years earlier MCU titles (Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder had multipliers of 2.2 and 2.3 respectively).As for the rest of the box office, theres little to get excited about, with nothing else grossing above $10 million as Hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends. When Black Panther opened in 2018, there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend, but Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $17.5 million and $17.3 million respectively. That weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend Take away the $22 million gap between the two Black Panther films and theres still a $57 million gap between the two weekends. The difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses, but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months.John Wick: Chapter 4, which is the biggest grosser of the rough post-summer, pre-Wakanda Forever season, came in second with just $8.6 million. Despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend, the numbers didnt totally collapse, dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million. Worldwide it is at $352 million, which isnt a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget. Still, its the biggest of any film since Thor: Love and Thunder, though Wakanda Forever will overtake it any day now.John Wick: Chapter 4 came in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the seasons most durable grasses and one of the years few bright spots when it comes to films for adults. The domestic cume is $56.5 million Fourth place went to Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile, which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $3.2 million sixth weekend and $40.8 million cume., in fact ), which isnt surprising considering its the only family film on the market, and its John Wick: Chapter 4 to grossing four times its $11.4 million opening. Still, the $72.6 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget, though a number of international markets have yet to open.Finishing up the top five is Smile, which had its biggest weekend drop yet, falling 42% for a $2.3 million seventh weekend. Of course, thats no reason to frown for the horror film, which has a domestic cume of $103 million and a global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million.The one new specialty title of note comes from a filmmaker we dont typically associate with the specialty box office: Steven Spielberg. The Beards semi-autobiographical family drama John Wick: Chapter 4 opened in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to $160k, a $40k average. The film expands to 600 theaters the day before Thanksgiving, and it has the potential to break out in a way that none of the other seasons awards contenders have. Were also seeing very solid numbers from John Wick: Chapter 4, which grossed $1.7 million this weekend for a seventh-place finish, bringing its cume to $5.8 million.
