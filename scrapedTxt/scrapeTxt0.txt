Majesty DigitalsFollow--ListenShareIfyou feel like your brain is always anticipating or noticing problems, know its not your fault: humans have a hardwired negativity bias. When we have a negative experience, it often immediately gets stored in our working memory in order to help protect us from potential future harm.A positive experience, on the other hand, only tends to form a new neural pathway if you deliberately linger on it. Ordinary little moments, which are often the happiest ones, simply arent as dramatic. We dont remember them as events unless theyre unusual, or we really savor them.If we dont actively counteract our default mode of scanning for problems, we will become so drained and discouraged that well lack the skill and energy needed to effectively address those very problems. And of course, we will also enjoy our life much less. (More on that in this article and this Help Existing podcast episode.)What follows are some of the best tips Ive learned from Buddhist Monk Tashi Nyima about how to combat negativity bias, as well as some simple practices Ive made up that work for me. This isnt about false-positive thinking  this is about training yourself to appreciate and be energized by noticing what is also there: the good.In order to practice noticing the good, we have to make it a habit of the mind to pause and savor. The more somatically and longer you can let in a feeling of appreciation, the deeper neural pathway you will form, according to Dr. Rick Hanson, neuroscientist and author of Hardwiring Happiness. Its good to aim for at least 1530 seconds to let a positive moment really sink in  and to enjoy the feeling as deeply as possible.Photo by Rachel KrantzThe key is a matter of degree: the longer, the more intense, and the more felt in the body an experience is the more it will be encoded in neural structure, Dr. Hanson writes. Its also known that negative experiences have an advantage: they get encoded more readily. So we are trying to do two things: steepen the learning curve from useful, beneficial experiences, and compensate for the negativity bias of the brain.Personally, I like to do things like looking for the faces in trees (as evidenced above), pausing whenever a bird lands on a tree outside my window, and taking walks without headphones so that I can focus on appreciating the sensory experiences I encounter organically.Ive been keeping a gratitude journal for three years now, and its had a profound impact on the tendencies of my mind, the lens through which I see the world. The idea is simple: at the end of the day, write down five good things about that day. Thats training your mind to be on the lookout for the good.Fixating on negative experiences increases stress, but we can reorient our minds toward a more balanced outlook with this simple act every day. With regular practice, our minds will develop the tendency to notice good experiences instead of focusing exclusively on the negative.Martin Seligmans research measuring the impact of writing down just three good things a day found that after only one week, people reported being happier than before. Many participants kept the practice going after the study was over. In follow-up tests, those peoples happiness kept increasing for months after that.I use this 5-year journal thats already dated. I like seeing what I was grateful for over the years, and it motivates me to keep the practice going.If you have a tendency towards anxiety, Tashi suggests that you can also focus your five good things on your senses, in order to ground you: one good thing I saw, one, one good thing I heard, one good thing I smelled, one good thing I touched, or one good thing I thought.podcasts.apple.comThe truth is, as many things that are going wrong are also, in many ways, going right. Consider the parts of our bodies that are not breaking down at any moment, the areas of the world not at war, and the fact you even have the ability to read this right now.But sometimes, were too depressed and overwhelmed to see what we should rejoice about. The good news is, you dont have to start with yourself. In Buddhism, there is an instruction to rejoice in the happiness and the virtue of others. Sometimes we have little to celebrate personally, and then we become overwhelmed with sadness or grief, or incapacity, or helplessness. But we have to remember that somebody is always celebrating something, something wonderful, that has happened in their lives, Tashi said.Wonderful doesnt have to be earth-shaking  you can rejoice in seeing a squirrel find a nut. You can rejoice in the sun on your skin, a mother you pass making her child laugh. And on and on. You can even rejoice in what is no doubt happening to someone at this exact moment: when Im down, I sometimes like to imagine the fact that someone, somewhere, is having the best moment of their lives, or just now met a person they will fall deeply in love with.If we are willing to open our hearts, our eyes, and our ears, there is always something to celebrate, Tashi said. We are, sadly, more attuned to the 10,000 sufferings than the 10,000 joys. Because, well, theyre so evident. Theyre everywhere. But wherever there is that kind of suffering, theres also always somebody whos doing something right.You can also exercise this muscle of noticing the good  rather than fixating on the negative  while driving (or biking, or walking, etc). Most of us only notice the drivers who dont drive well.But if you are actually honest, you have to say that most people are driving okay. Otherwise, wed all be dead! Tashi said. He suggests you make an effort to practice noticing the good drivers. You can even congratulate them in your mind when they make a safe or considerate move. And even the ones who are driving inappropriately, I have a little thing that I say in my mind to them: may you arrive safely and swiftly. Turn it into an opportunity to at least bless them  because they need it!Again, noticing the good is not false Pollyanna thinking  these things are really, truly also happening. You are simply working on seeing the nature of reality more clearly.Im Jewish, so complaining is a form of self-expression I was raised to be fluent in. But when I started trying to practice right speech (more on that principle in another post, but basically: asking yourself, is it true, is it kind, is it beneficial, is it timely), I realized that complaining was often not aligned with how I wanted to act or speak, and often involved a lot of exaggeration or self-centeredness.I use an app called HabitShare that I highly recommend for holding yourself accountable, and I added No Complaining Today to it. Its not that I never complain anymore, but when I do, I at least notice it now. And I do think that limiting my complaining speech (its too loud, Im too hot, Im tired, Im hungry) has helped me identify with unpleasant sensory experiences less.Im not arguing for spiritual bypassing here, or not speaking up when you or others are being harmed. Not at all. But when it comes to your own transient moods, you might find applying this lens and adding it to HabitShare  along with the other tips on this list  helps rewire negative thought patterns.The virtuous cycle is exactly what it sounds like  the exact opposite of a vicious cycle. You probably know that a vicious cycle is: something that creates a negative condition that loops back and creates further negativity in the mind, leading to further negativity in speech and action. A virtuous cycle is exactly the opposite. We create it by doing good deeds, big and small.Notice how your smiling at a passing stranger lights them up. Engage with the people who work in stores, and thank them for their work. Volunteer, and be generous. Basically, view ordinary life as a constant opportunity to see how much good you can do. The more you keep your own virtuous cycle going, the more good you will see and make  and the less disempowered youll feel.When you notice yourself acting negatively in some way, dont beat yourself up over it. But do note it  and see how in ways big or small, it led to a negative effect, such as feeling unhappy or causing you to snap at someone. Then try to see if you can restart that virtuous cycle with an act of kindness, big or small. And remember  acts of kindness literally create oxytocin in the brain. So youre actually getting high on life while helping others.
