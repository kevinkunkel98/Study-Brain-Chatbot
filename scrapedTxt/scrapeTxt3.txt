The potential is there, but the execution isnt. Arcade is finally here to change that.Below, is 4 minutes of some of the most important information youll encounter in your Web3 journey. Day one alpha on the first ever gaming project who has a plan to do it right. Will we? You decide.Arcade will be the first ever widely adoptable NFT connected gaming universe, because were putting fun first. How?Created in Unreal Engine 5, and played in third person, the mind blowing Arcade Island will be your playground, providing a range of different experiences built on proven concepts for you to endlessly enjoy with friends. Youll be able to explore the world of intergalactic NFT-connected assets, building a collection of vehicles, vehicle cosmetics, real-estate, watercraft, aircraft, and much more all in a vibrant stylized 3D. oh yeah  and whats yours, is yours.Using the superpowers of modern development, youll be able to play with up to 10,000 players at once  on one single map. This means every in-game asset is completely universal if you own the 1 number plate, its non-fungible in-game, and non-fungible in your wallet.Writing up a AAA Web3 game concept is one thing, but actually creating it is another thing. Our plan to do so is as follows:For the first 6 months of 2023, well post viral & captivating short-form cinematics, documenting Arcades developments to form an immersive story of creation. This can not only be followed live by the Web3 community, but be a point of historical reference for anyone to look back at come time of release. This investment ensures we have crystal clear credibility & an unbreakable pre-existing community going into release. What youre witnessing right now, is the beginning of this phase.The development documentation will lead up to the Arcade game trailer  a 6090 second work of art matching up to the quality seen in Othersides work, perfectly displaying the countless insanely fun activities to do inside Arcade, the mind blowing cosmetics universe, community capabilities and much more. Every single aspect of this trailer  along with its release, has already been optimised to ensure an absolute Web3 explosion.Finally, in the 12 months following the trailer drop, we will release the Arcade Avatars. This will be an NFT collection comprised of 10,000 hand drawn human avatars perfectly displaying Arcades incredibly unique aesthetic, drawn by the one and only [REVEALING LATER], who is renowned for his impossible to replicate style  landing him jobs for Apple, Google, Adobe, Disney, and the NBA. It just so happens that his style matches the Arcade aesthetic flawlessly  and hes working with us full time, because he loves the vision (remember, he knows what you dont yet).After the NFT Collection is released, well be able to instantly begin game development, as were currently in the planning phase with a studio of Unreal Engine wizards  boasting 75+ years of combined experience and connections to those such as Improbable, (Otherside developers). Simultaneously, we will embark on a publicly documented multi-week mass hiring run to build an elite team of the best worldwide talent.Thank you for taking the time to learn more about our Arcade vision & plans.

I love you and im sorry. A lot of that anger didnt belong to you. You have a lot to be mad about, everyone all in your cup. You have the right to get buck. Its okay.you can let it go now. Its okay to release that version of you. We give you permission to cut chords from everyone and everything that no longer align with your highest good. Call back all your resources and energy beloved. Its your birth right to be free.In the vastness of our existence lies a profound journey, one that transcends the physical realm and delves deep into the essence of our being. It is a travel venture that few dare to embark on  an expedition to master the inner compass and break the chains of toxic social structures that have stifled the human spirit for generations. This is a tale of inspiration for the heart of a socialist, a story that resonates with those who seek to leave behind the shackles of old paradigms and embrace a new, liberated way of living.Embodying the Many Versions of SelfIn a world that often emphasizes external achievements and appearances, our journey begins by turning inward. Contrary to societal norms, we seek to embrace and honor the many versions of ourselves that coexist within. This internal exploration is a full-time job, demanding courage and faith to confront our deepest fears and aspirations. With each step, we find fellow omens along the way, guiding us effortlessly towards the highest versions of ourselves.Trauma-Informed & The Gift of Living Fully PresentTo navigate this path effectively, we must become trauma-informed individuals. Recognizing our triggers and sitting with the heavy emotional flashbacks which are painful, but it is through this process that we grow and heal. Choosing to be fully present rather than numbing ourselves in the void allows us to transform and thrive in the face of adversity.The Gift of Imperfection and Non-PossessionAs we progress, we come to realize that this journey is not about perfection but about growth. We are not possessors of other human beings, and thus, we do not lose them when they depart from our lives. We cherish the moments we share with others, knowing that each individuals path may lead them on a different course. The gift lies in the unique connections we make, in the lessons learned, and in the awareness that some paths may converge again in the future.Basking in the Light of TransformationThrough this transformative journey, we encounter seasons of beauty, joy, and fulfillment. Each relationship, even the challenging ones, contributes to the tapestry of our lives. The magic emerges when pain and void dissipate, replaced by the radiance of newfound understanding and growth. These are the moments we cherish, the ones that enrich our lives with profound happiness.ConclusionTo all those who dare to embark on this inspiring journey of inner compass mastery and generational cycle breaking, I extend my heartfelt wishes. Embrace the process of becoming trauma-informed and choosing to be present. Relish in the imperfections and non-possessiveness of human connections, and bask in the light of transformation that awaits you.May each step you take bring you closer to your highest self and a liberated way of being. The journey is not always smooth, but it is undoubtedly worth every moment. As you walk this path, remember that you are not alone; we are all interconnected, supporting one another as fellow travelers. Embrace the power within, break free from the chains that bind, and live a life that transcends the limitations of the flesh  for it is deeper than the physical realm.One Luv- Trish----Trish Perez--Trish Perez--Trish Perez--Unbecoming--896Karen NimmoinOn The Couch--57Conrad Tan--Brad Salmeron--Nick Wignall--38Zulie RaneinThe Startup--896HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeams
