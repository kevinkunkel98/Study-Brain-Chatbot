Macweazle FischerFollow--1ListenShareFor a long, long time, I thought I was doing alright with how I organise my life. Then, when party time was over and work started rearing its head to grab more and more of my daytime, I thought: Well, maybe try to look into all those Task-manager, To-Do-List, Project-management apps. There are enough of them around to re-tile my houses roof.During the years, I tried a lot of them. But, in all honesty, not a single one ever took hold. It was either too cumbersome, or it didnt play well with other apps, or something else was amiss. Admittedly, I am somewhat difficult. But, since my workload and responsibilities did increase rapidly in the last couple of months, I am again looking for the one thing (or combination of things) which would ease the organising.To make it a bit harder  I prefer to have my own methods, challenging and changing them when necessary. Adhering to a structure, however elaborate, just for the structures sake, seems like madness to me.Let me assure you, getting through each of the applications took quite an amount of time; there is just the faint glimmer of hope to find one I can truly work with to drive me forward. Or, for that matter, find one I want to work with. To make it more fair, I reserved a week for each app, getting the hang of it, and learning about its capabilities and limitations. And, if necessary, how I can work around it by using Shortcuts or AppleScript or black magic.Disclaimer: I am having no relationship whatsoever with the mentioned software products, nor did I ask or receive anything from their makers. Any expressed opinions, and errors, are mine and mine alone. Any logos in this piece and the ones thereafter are copyrighted by their respective owners. So, dont sue me.First, it has to work well with other apps: Fantastical, DevonThink Pro, Mail  the basics.Second, only native applications. My experience with Electron apps is murky, and that only because of me being polite.Third, without an iPad/iPhone app, theres no way Id even consider tinkering around with it.Fourth, syncing  I dont care which method youre using, but either be GDPR-compliant, allow for providing my servers or use iCloud/CloudKit (yeah, dont nail me on the wall. Its just so damned convenient).Fifth, if the app is not using the builtin features of macOS (using share sheet, Shortcuts/Automator/AppleScript actions) I wont bother. I know that kind of duplicates the first point. Sue me.OK, that was that.The picture I did put on top of this segment shows, in a simplified way, the structure I will try to implement using the different applications. I did omit the private stuff for now because it is private. Even as a simplification, it is somewhat related to my day job. Note that some, like those Projects I so carefully put into their place, have sometimes the idea to become matryoshka puppets, birthing new subprojects as they go along.What I want to have is a hub which either contains all relevant information or links to it. It needs to somehow acknowledge my calendar as well, having a review mechanism, notifies me of upcoming deadlines and provides a daily overview of what I planned to do on that day.Since my calendar is where I live for my co-workers, a means to easily block parts of it is necessary. Since Im grabbing for the stars anyway, lets add back-linking, to the task or project or however the naming convention goes, from the calendar as well.A project, by my definition, is something spanning multiple days, or multiple things to do, and needs a proper description in its set up. Documentation and links to the relevant communication are part of any project, and Id like to have at least links to them in it.Then there is meeting notes. If Im unlucky, tons of them. Those I want to have in there as well.For implementing something akin to the structure mentioned before, Im going to the dark side  the faster, more seductive but ultimately dumber way  by trying to re-create it within the apps I try to bend to my will.That is almost certainly going to fail, since each software has its own way of doing things and no team of developers would even dream of coming up with my own deranged ideas on how Id like it to be.Even only glancing on the picture does show some serious amount of nesting in my initial overview. Im uncertain if thats really necessary or advisable. It might make things way easier to flatten things out a tad, well see. The structure isnt chiseled in stone, which means Im open to adapt  within reason, that is.Then theres tags, or not. Personally, I do like tagging stuff. For example, knowing if some employee, a device or (gasp!) one of my servers is showing up on my horizon way too often might point me towards implementing measures to mitigate those occurrences.Lets start with the obvious  OmniFocus. The first time I started with it was in 2009, at least according to the App Store. Cant even remember how the interface looked like back then, but it was enticing enough to buy OmniFocus for iPad two years later. For those interested in ancient history, you can still view the release video of OmniFocus for Mac here.Next in my lineup is Things 3, which has at least as much of a history accumulated as OmniFocus. Sadly, I never got myself into buying it before and only recently came back to it (due to it being rebated by almost 50% last autumn). See an early review here.Craft did make it into the news last year, as far as Im following those things, and is by far the youngest contender in this batch. As far as I could gather it started in 2019, and just recently announced its very own plugin system, aptly named Craft X. While not actually being set out as a task manager, it does offer a lot of features I want in one, which is why I included it. History? Well, there isnt much, but if interested: here.NotePlan started somewhere in 2016 as a side project from the developer, but it has been upgraded, enhanced and rebuilt since then. As with Craft and OmniFocus it supports custom plugins, which are so far being made available for free. It is insofar unique that it does solely rely on plain text (well, Markdown) files for the content you put in it, which means even if you drop out of using NotePlan your notes are still pretty much available to you. And I found a historical review here.Last, and not really a contender in that there isnt a single app but a multitude of them, is the barebones Apple ecosystem: Notes, Mail, Calendar, Reminders. Apple did add  and, on macOS, during the Monterey beta, removed  interesting features to their lineup, especially on iPadOS.I never intended to write this. It needed way more time than estimated, and it is only useful for some people. But, since I still am in dire need and started a simple list to compare features and do have a minimal presence here, I thought: Why not?For those with intimate knowledge of the parts I failed to find, was too lazy to figure out, or simply am prejudiced against: Im sorry for having wasted your time.In alphabetical order (sorry, Things 3):Apple Notes, Reminders, Calendar, MailCraft  not finished yetNotePlanOmniFocus 3Things 3Agenda----1Current job: Macadmin.
