Sandesha JaitapkarFollowArtha India Ventures--ListenShareLast month, Anirudh spoke about closing a feedback loop with your managers and peers in the CANI meeting. He stated that feedback is a mechanism for change and if theres one thing that we know our team want, its to develop and change for the better. Daily and weekly meetings focus on specific projects & their timelines. What we miss is constructive feedback during these meetings. This got me thinking, why is it so hard to give or receive constructive feedback?How do you challenge someone directly while still caring for them? Its a sweet spot that we sometimes struggle to find, with most of us shying away from giving feedback altogether. But once you cross that hurdle and share the feedback, what next? The responsibility now shifts to the receiver.For most of us, receiving constructive feedback can feel like an attack on ourselves, so we go into self-preservation mode, so we do the only logical thing there is to do. Self-preservation can either look like getting defensive or being dismissive. Sound familiar? The bodys natural response to a threat is fight or flight.So why does receiving tough feedback, even when given the right way, have the fight or flight effect on us?The answer is simple: The feedback feels like an attack/threat on our identity.Identity is the story we tell ourselves about who we are and what the future holds for us, and when critical feedback is incoming, that story is under attack. -Douglas Stone and Sheila HeenRecently, I read about a concept that Ill call the story we tell ourselves. We have certain beliefs about ourselves and who we think we are. We also have opinions about how we interact with the world around us, some based on facts and some built up in our minds.These beliefs define our worldview, and anything that attempts to go against those beliefs is seen as a threat.If, for example, my manager tells me that Im not doing a great job, depending on my belief of self, I could respond in either of the following ways:They must be wrong, Im a great employee and they are lucky to have me. Discards the feedback.ORThey must be right. Im not good enough. Takes the feedback deeper than intended.After a few moments of reflection, here is a breakdown of the steps I would recommend:These steps will vary depending on the situation, and you can add or remove what doesnt apply to your situation.Learning how to embrace criticism is an ongoing process. Sometimes youll get it right; sometimes, you wont. Its all in daily practice.As you embrace the art of receiving feedback, take some time and notice the instances when you cant seem to take in the input. Is it the person giving the feedback, how it was issued, the situation etc.? Identify what or who your blockers are and find ways around them. Remember, its all about progress rather than perfection.I wish you all the best on your journey!#ChooseToThrive----Artha India Venturesniche: KEEP IT REALSandesha Jaitapkar--Artha GroupinArtha India Ventures--Artha GroupinArtha India Ventures--1Sandesha JaitapkarinThe Startup--1Dr RB @Influens--AL Anany--103T.
