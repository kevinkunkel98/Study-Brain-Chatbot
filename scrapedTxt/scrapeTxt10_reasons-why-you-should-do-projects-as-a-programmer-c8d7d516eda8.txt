Chekwube UtomiFollow--3ListenShareAre you a newbie in computer programming who have been postponing the day to start a project and build portfolios? Or do you think you need to take some more tutorials before you can start your project? If you are, please leave that position and pick up a project no matter how simple. Without projects, you cannot become a good programmer. There are numerous tutorials out there but if you think you have to consume all of them before starting your project, then, you will likely run into a the vicious cycle called tutorial hell. Instead of picking up another tutorial, why not try your hands on a simple project that is based on what you have learnt so far. You will benefit more from projects than mere following tutorials. In this blog, I will share with some of the benefits you will derive from doing projects. Lets dive in:There is no amount of tutorial that will teach you everything you need to know as a developer. Most of the skills you need can only be gotten when you get your hands dirty with projects. When you do projects, you are going to encounter situations that were not covered in the tutorial classes. This will then force you to do extra research on Google, Stackoverflow and what have you in other to get things figured out. By so doing you will be learning more about how things work.Another important reason why you should do projects is that doing projects will confirm your skills. You cannot really tell how much you understand a particular programming concept just by watch tutorials or reading books. The only concrete way you have to verify that you understand what you have been taught is by doing projects. This will also help to boost your confidence as you now have the evidence to show that you are a programmer.There is no perfect programmer; every programmer runs into bugs from time to time. Your ability to fix the bug is what makes you a better programmer. When you do projects, you are going to run into bugs and you dont have any option than to fix them. This will then improve your debugging skills which is one of the crucial skills every programmer should have.Problem solving is very crucial in programming. If you are learning how to program and you are not using your knowledge to solve real life problems, then you are not doing it the right way. One way to acquire problem solving skills is by doing projects. You have to identify a problem, think of how solve it and then proffer solution. The more problems you solve with your projects, the better your problem solving skill.Sometime ago, I applied for the position of a python instructor in an organization. Before I was invited for the interview, the employer requested to see the projects that I have done. Luckily for me I was able to submit sufficient projects to secure the job. The same is applicable to host of other employers; they want to see what you have done before they can give you the job. They believe that your project is the evidence that you have the skills required for the job. So if you want to work in any organization as a programmer, bear in mind that they may want to see your projects before inviting you for the interview.Your project can become a source of wealth to you. Mark Zuckerberg and his friends did not start Facebook with business in mind. They started it as a simple project to connect students in Harvard University. But today, the simple project is now a multibillion dollar venture. If you do a project that is viable for business, then be sure that you will soon begin to harvest money out of it.Conclusion, what are you waiting for? Start a project now. It is your pathway to becoming a better programmer.
