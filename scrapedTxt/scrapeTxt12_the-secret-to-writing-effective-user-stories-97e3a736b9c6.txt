WayneReidUKFollow--ListenShareAs I sit in my home office finally catching up on all the emails and adhoc queries I receive throughout the day albeit after work hours! I finally have some space outside of the many meetings to focus on work. Not a good working relationship I know!Part of my role as a Cloud Security Architect is to help define security requirements and ensure security is applied across the design, build and run phase of cloud deliveries.Anyway, as part of that we need to identify who is going to be using these cloud solutions from the developers, to the end users to the security admins and whoever else. Each one of these users or I should say roles have a story to play out. It is the story that we are trying to write, so how should we write it is what I am going to demonstrate here. It wont take long it should be only a few lines!There is a known template or phrase and it goes like thisAs a.I .. so that Another way to interpret this phrase is:As a (role), I want (function) so that (business value).Bit of history for you, This phrase originated from a lady named Rachel Davies in the early 2000s when she worked at company called Connextra.Over the course of time it is often history that gets re-written. Its a common approach to the English way, re-writing history! Thats another story. Lets get back on track as thats a story for another day.I find a more effective way is to introduce the same 3 elements of the Rachel Davies template and change it to use Who, What and Why. Here are the bullets that describe how they relate.Lets look at this a little closer:WhoEssentially this is how we categorise the user for example right now I am writing this in a Sharepoint online website so could categorise me as a Casual Writer of Sharepoint. By Casual I mean i dont do anything advanced in Sharepoint i dont develop, architect I merely consume the basic functionality of the service.I write and publish. There are other users lets say Power Users who use more advanced functionality such as design Sharepoint sites etc. This story would look something like As a power user, I want to manage posts in SharepointWhatThis part of the phrase states what is desired as in What it is they want. In my previous Who section the power user wanted to manage posts. Therefore that user profile (Power User) would need or require the ability to CRUD as in Create, Read, Update and Delete posts.WhyThis is where we realise the value of the story or the purpose of the function and how it affects the user. For example earlier i mentioned As a power user, I want to manage posts in Sharepoint. Now lets add a final clause to explain why. As a power user, I want to manage posts in Sharepoint so that I can make amendments where necessary.so why dont you give it a go when you are trying to define requirements of a delivery solution or anything for that matter? Its particularly good for when you are working with teams and want to talk things through or whiteboard.Why not identify all the Users of the product/service and write a story for them to understand the actual requirements.Write it out As a __________, I_______ so that _________ asking the team to fill in the gaps. Its great because its a pretty natural way of speaking so stakeholders particularly like it.If you have anything to build onto this phrase please share it in the comments.----I'm a cloud security crusader with over 10 years experience, passionate about future tech and cloud innovation.
