Tatyana LailoFollowScylla AI--ListenShareThe use of drones and other UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in the security industry has been widely debated over the past years. Uncertainty around FAA regulations, safety, privacy and technical issues were cause for concern. Nevertheless, drone technology will only grow in the coming years. Industries across the globe are increasingly adopting drone technology to improve safety, drive efficiency and gather data. According to forecasts, the global commercial drone market size valued at USD 13.44 billion in 2020 is likely to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 57.5% from 2021 to 2028.This massive growth can be attributed to the multiple innovative uses of drones in the security industry including monitoring assets, threat detection, emergency response, inventory surveillance and data collection for actionable business insights. Additionally, drones are witnessing high demand due to their capability to work at potentially dangerous and inaccessible places. The 2021 FAA Rule changes may encourage even greater market growth.Drones can provide a lot of possibilities as a physical security technology tool. Lets figure out the most important use cases, challenges and the role of AI technology in increasing drone technology adoption for security purposes.24/7 surveillance with dronesSecurity drones used for video surveillance can provide practical and necessary functions. Drones can serve to augment human guards by patrolling the worksites and capturing aerial footage of the assets, securing perimeters and preventing break-ins. Integrated with AI technologies they can offer real-time streaming of data 24 hours a day. With AI, drones become smarter and can automatically identify objects that post threats, alert security of the danger. They can also be configured to initiate specific actions in real-time if dangerous objects, weapons, perimeter intrusion or anomalous behavior are detected. With smart eyes in the sky, the security personnel can expand their real-time situational awareness while making the use of their human resources more effective. AI video analytics enables them to make faster decisions for incident response and carry out remote security operations.The ability to cover vast terrains and pick useful data makes UAVs apt for threat detection everywhere, ensuring perimeter protection and even monitoring large crowds. Drones can also serve as a deterrence to unfriendly elements.While securing parking lots, drones can compare license plates against those on the hot sheet, in this way helping security staff spot stolen cars or identify unauthorized vehicles.Scylla AI-powered Drone Security System is trained to effectively operate drones cameras with non-static environments and backgrounds. We use proprietary algorithms to enable smart digital zooming and lightning-fast detection to operate at larger distances and run smart surveillance.Read more at https://www.scylla.ai/how-drones-are-used-to-optimize-physical-security/----Scylla AITatyana LailoinScylla AI--Tatyana LailoinScylla AI--Tatyana LailoinScylla AI--Tatyana LailoinScylla AI--AL Anany--103Unbecoming--917Andrew--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--568Dmitry KruglovinBetter Programming--48Maximilian VogelinMLearning.ai--98HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeams
