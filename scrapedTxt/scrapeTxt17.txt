Actually Linuxs revolution was completely by accident .At 3 November 1971 , A company called AT&T began developing an operating system to be able to develop applications for hardware . AT&T used to provide telephony services that time . They called the operating system UNIX . One of the developers working on that OS was Dennis Ritchie ; the creator of the C programming language and one of his friends and co-workers Mr.Thompson , they did develop the Unix Operating system with C programming language on the PDP-7 Computers (Because Mr.Thompson was satisfied with that computer) .When UNIX was developed , it was something new and yummy to other companies and geeks as they started using the source and forked UNIX to re-build some new UNIX-Like Operating Systems , as a matter of fact ( Solaris , BSD , MAC ) are UNIX-fork operating systems .UNIX ruined everything . Unix Commercialized itself . they closed the sources . so that time the phrase  open source  was nothing . here was a man , Called Richard Stallman who disagreed with the policies . He believed in opensource and the world of free software  as he initiated the free software foundation or FSF  . This is where the GNU project begins You may get shocked by the photo but believe me this is exactly the fact . This is the GNU logo :) ( but the logo is black and white ) .gnu.orgGnu is and operating system that is free software , that is , it respects users freedom .Richard Stallman found the project at 1978 at MIT . The original purpose of GNU was a free operating system that everyone can use and every can have access to the source code , every person can see the code , find bugs and vulnerabilities , improve the code , change the code and so on !Free as in Free speech , not as in Free BeerThe name GNU was chosen because it met a few requirements; first, it was a recursive acronym for GNUs Not Unix, second, because it was a real word, and third, it was fun to say (or sing).The word free in free software pertains to freedom, not price. You may or may not pay a price to get GNU software. Either way, once you have the software you have four specific freedoms in using it. The freedom to run the program as you wish; the freedom to copy the program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; the freedom to change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code; the freedom to distribute an improved version and thus help build the community. (If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, or you may give away copies.)August 25 , 1991 is the day , Linux changed the world . Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux Kernel , ( Linux is a Kernel not an OS ) . Linus was a computer student at the university of Helsinki , Finland  .He wanted to have the same operating system they had in the university Minix  at home , so he started writing a kernel himself . and this is what he said :Linus Benedict TorvaldsHello everybody out there using minix  Im doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, wont be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. Id like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons, among other things). . .Any suggestions are welcome, but I wont promise Ill implement them :-) Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi) PS. Yes  its free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT protable[sic] (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as thats all I have :-(And this is a summarized history of how Linux rose :) Next I will write about how distributions emerged !----Changing Coffee  to CODE - Here is about Linux , C , System Programming and others .Girish Venkatachalam--Rishabh Agarwal--Madhan Chinnasamy--Ron KaminskyinOSINT TEAM--2Sandesh Shetty--Network N!nja--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeamsIoTeX_KoreaFollow--ShareW3bstream Devnet  IoTeX DePIN(   )      ,     .Devnet        . ,                  .
