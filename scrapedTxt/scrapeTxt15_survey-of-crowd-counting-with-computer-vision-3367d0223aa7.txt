AI News Clips by Morris Lee: News to help your R&DFollow--ListenShareSurvey of crowd counting with computer visionRevisiting Crowd Counting: State-of-the-art, Trends, and Future PerspectivesarXiv paper abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07271v1arXiv PDF paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07271v1.pdfCrowd counting is an effective tool for situational awareness in public places. The methods evolved over time vary in many aspects such as model architecture, input pipeline, learning paradigm, computational complexity, and accuracy gains etc. present a systematic and comprehensive review of the most significant contributions in the area of crowd counting. provides a more meaningful categorization of the most significant contributions by model architectures, learning methods (i.e., loss functions), and evaluation methods (i.e., evaluation metrics). chose prominent and distinct works and excluded similar works. also sort the well-known crowd counting models by their performance over benchmark datasets Stay up to date.
