Teri RadichelFollowCloud Security--ListenSharePart of my series on Automating Cybersecurity Metrics. The Code.I wrote about how I was trying to get a short code for AWS Pinpoint here:medium.comI have requested a pinpoint short code a few times on AWS and had issues getting through the process. This is the first time I got the following message. I dont recall seeing these fees in the AWS pricing I posted earlier. This message says you have to pay a $650 one time fee and $995 per month to use a US short code.Welp, that option is out for may little app that needs to send me a few notifications a month.I have an 800 number which seems weird to use for internal text messages but whatever works. As noted US phone numbers require a bunch of branding non-sense that doesnt apply to a phone number used for internal purposes within an organization. It seems that AWS needs to think through the internal use case a bit more and provide easier options for that. Am I missing it? This used to be much easier. Im sure its being locked down due to spam but there must be a better way to solve this problem for people who only want a number for an internal notification system. Maybe I need to explore some other services outside of AWS if this becomes too expensive.Heres the whole message:Follow for updates.Teri Radichel |  2nd Sight Lab 2023The best way to support this blog is to sign up for a Medium subscription using this link.

I was constantly preoccupied with my studies and never took the time to consider what I wanted, why I wanted it, and how I would go about achieving it. I always paid attention to others and prioritised their needs over my own. There were tasks and projects in Amal that helped me discover myself; there were many aspects of myself that I would not have known about if I hadnt joined Amal; Im good at leadership, which is something new for me to know about myself.I was always terrified of working in a team before I joined Amal. Working in a team has always seemed to me to be a great burden, and Ive either given up or had conflicts with other team members. Amal taught me to appreciate and accept other peoples ideas, as well as how to interact with them and convey my own perspective in a more effective way.We are facing the most crucial aspect of our lives: TIME. Every second person blames their inability to manage time, and I am one of them. I often complain about how time is running out; Im aware that Im slow at getting things done and lazy at doing things that Im not interested in. Amal showed me how to manage my time, which helped me prioritise my activities using techniques like pomodoro.Gratitude is a crucial aspect of our attitude, mental growth, and mental wellness. Gratitude makes a person feel better, it strengthens a persons bond with them, and it allows us to become emotionally linked to them. Showing gratitude not only makes people feel better, but it also makes us think better, making us more positive. Gratitude can help us become less self-centered. Thankfulness in the workplace offers numerous advantages. Many of the social, emotional, and personality benefits of practising gratitude on a regular basis may be applied to professional life as well. As Brain Trancy said, develop an attitude of gratitude and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation.----Syeda Sheharbano--Syeda Sheharbano--Syeda Sheharbano--Syeda Sheharbano--Brad Salmeron--Unbecoming--894Pranvi Shukla--2Nick Wignall--296Anna Sword--Karen NimmoinOn The Couch--54HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeamsYushan HuangFollow--Share Bonny&Read medium.com 01 IG  Bonny&Read #hashtag #B&Rminimalism 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10A  62  1929  Bonny&Read  KANO Model  William DuMouchel  A  KANO  KANO  I  4  ( 5 ) KANO  A  Bonny&Read  /  KANO 03 06  A  I  M  O Bonny&Read  62  NPS  NPS  40  Bonny&Read  84%  73%  Bonny&Read Bonny&Read  Bonny&Read  (UOID)  sharon19991222@gmail.com peggy6434@gmail.com maxmax86702@gmail.com----UI/UXYushan Huang--Yushan Huang--Yushan Huang--Yushan Huang--Unbecoming--896Tomas Pueyo--81Adham DannawayinUX Planet--111Zulie RaneinThe Startup--896Rosie HoggmascallinUX Collective--4Satya Reddy--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeams
