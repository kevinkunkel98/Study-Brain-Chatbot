Mehmet Akif TaFollow--ListenShareI think sms systems is more than a commercial tool or a messaging app.We can use Sms messages for get fancy announcements or send carrot cake recipe to your grandmother.All of us use WhatsApp for main messaging app, but I think sms is more international among all. Unfortunately, sms messages are not end to end secure. So a hacker who can connect your SIM, can see or read all your new sms messages. And sms messages are stored in your phone. And you cant send Memoji(Its basically your animated AR characters gif with audio), directly to an Android device, you have to use any third-party app to do it.These are mostly negative sides of sms. Well, what are the positive sides?First its too useful when you announce a party or a meeting. You can send thousands of message too fast, and you can customize your input like do bolder or italic. You can even type ascii to send. You can really good things if you take care your message, all you need is good emoji at good spot and a little bit of typography knowledge. Would you ask What is better features of sms instead of emails?. So sent emails can be get in spam folder. But all sms sent, get in all phone theyve sent.I think we can use Sms for doing announcement instead of WhatsApp or Email. And we can send more qualified content Sms messages.----Website: https://makiftasci.xyzMehmet Akif Ta--Mehmet Akif Ta--Unbecoming--894The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--567Zulie RaneinThe Startup--895Dmitry KruglovinBetter Programming--46Love SharmainByteByteGo System Design Alliance--54Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--352HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeamsTitik Terang NewsFollow--ListenShareUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) astronaut Sultan al-Neyadi shared the appearance of the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia from outer space.
