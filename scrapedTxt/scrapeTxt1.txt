Welcome to my Medium page, its good to have you here. I am Vyom Jaiman as you would already know. I just started this page, as this post goes out, as a new hobby and improve my skills in writing. Since Im just starting to start this journey with all of you. Well not that many of you will be reading this when this comes out though. That aside this post is to lay down some ground rules and usual working of my page for you guys and for myself.Firstly, the first rule of this page is a simple motto Live and let live. Yep as simple as that and the only one. I am sure that I will write things that might not sit well with some and some would say things that will not please people around them. So, at such times just keep toxicity as minimum as possible and if possible forgive and forget. And as for the topics I will be usually posting about or rather the things I will talk about these topics would be my personal opinion and nothing more. I might be wrong with some perspectives and right with others. The usual topics I might post about will include topics of usual public debate, global issues, political issues and such. I will try not to touch sensitive topics as much but will express my opinions on ones you might want to know about. Granted that it wont make much of a fuss at my page. Other than maintaining a certain level of peace I wont ask for more as you come here to read my stuff.Now about the frequency at which I will upload my work would be about that of 4 times a month at least. There is simple reason for that being that Im new here. I will need get used the platform and the community not mention the whole writing and posting process. Im afraid that I might not even be able to keep the 4 times a month thing up. Even so I will try to keep myself committed to it. Nonetheless, I apologize if I am unable to keep it up. Regardless of the matters mentioned earlier I want to be able to connect with my readers. So I hope you guys will give me a certain amount of feedback and we even welcome a certain amount of criticism. There is saying that goes Choose a foe that find faults in you over a blindly praising ally or something like that. I said this earlier but one of the reasons that Im here for is to improve my writing skills. Considering this factor I will really appreciate some constructive feedback from you guys. Of course as long as it doesnt become toxic to people around us. I also wish to write on the topics you suggest. If a topic that a majority of you guys request to me to write about and is not much of intimidating or unsettling topic from my perspective I would be very well much be willing to write about it.All in all Im quite excited to start this journey with all of you though I doubt there will be many or rather any at this phase of the page. Thinking about it is makes me quite anxious actually after all this is a big platform, me going unnoticed is a possibility after all. Also, knowing that people will know about me and my work makes me feel extremely nervous. Yet I can only be optimistic about it and improve my work every time I write to keep my readers fascinated and intrigued. My feelings aside I hope that you guys like my posts. Whelp with this let me end this one here. Have good day or good evening depending on where you live. And remember to wear a mask and stay safe. Until next time.----Unbecoming--894Nick Wignall--296Zulie RaneinThe Startup--895The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--567Emily Cook, PhD--Karen NimmoinOn The Couch--54HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speechTeamsFollow--ShareL.
